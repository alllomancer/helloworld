Hello World for Golang containerized, auto build by travis, anb deployed to aws using terraform 

This is a fork of https://github.com/go-training/helloworld due to the fact that the project doesnt
have a docker file, and uses the go test framework.

the docker is built and tested using travis-ci and uploaded to alllomancer/helloworld.
the docker repo is public and the travis file has secure access to upload to it.
